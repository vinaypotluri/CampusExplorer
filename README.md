Exploring the University campus is much easier than one can imagine with the offical Wayne State University's Campus Explorer.

The project involved developing a Location Based app for google glass and android users.  Location based updates within the University Campus such as building name, address and the available resources are pushed to the glass's interface in real time. The Google glass applications commonly known as Glassware are built using Glass Development Kit (GDK) and Android SDK with the help of mirror APIs for extracting data from the web. A first of its kind implementation by a University for the emerging technology using the latest Augmented Reality Technology.

The app is focussed initially to benefit the incoming college freshmen who are totally new to the University and need assistance. The app here acts as a virtual assistant to tour the University. It consists of a camera view with a compass and GPS values combined. The app overlays point of Interests over the screen and changes the Points with orientation of the device.
